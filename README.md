# pet-social-network
just an idea I thought up of right now, might work on it later. I think this could go far considering I am interested in bridging the gap between animals &amp; humans. By connecting those who make a living from helping pets (dogs, cats, other animals etc,) find loving homes, I hope that this idea can go far because I really enjoy the aspect of really going the extra mile to verify pet sellers with people who desire a pet(s). In these challenging times I feel like this idea might just help people who need the loving comforts of pets to connect (either through video, chat) to verified pet sellers, rather than getting carried away by advertisements on some sites that can either scam them of their money or otherwise trick them into paying and then scamming them of their money. I saw an article today (December 18th) that made me want to create either a website or application that solves this problem
